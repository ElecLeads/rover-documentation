## Introduction

The **McGill Rover Team** is dedicated to designing and building advanced rovers to compete in international competitions such as the University Rover Challenge (URC). Our mission is to innovate in robotics while fostering a collaborative environment for students.

## Project Overview

The McGill Rover is a multi-functional robotic platform designed for a variety of planetary exploration tasks. It incorporates systems for mobility, manipulation, science, and autonomy. This rover is a testament to the interdisciplinary collaboration of various engineering and science disciplines.

## Team Structure

Our team is divided into several sub-teams, each focusing on a critical aspect of the roverâ€™s development:

- **Mechanical Team**: Responsible for the structural design and mechanical systems.
- **Electrical Team**: Handles the power systems, sensors, and communications.
- **Software Team**: Focuses on control systems, autonomy, and software development.
- **Science Team**: Develops the rover's ability to collect and analyze scientific data.

## Software Systems

The software for the rover is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. This section covers:

- [Control Systems](./software/control-systems.md)
- [Autonomous Navigation](./software/autonomous-navigation.md)
- [User Interface](./software/user-interface.md)

We primarily use **ROS (Robot Operating System)** to manage our software components. Please refer to the [Software Setup Guide](./software/setup.md) to configure your environment.

## Hardware Systems

The rover is equipped with state-of-the-art hardware for planetary exploration. Key systems include:

- **Chassis & Suspension**: Designed for rugged terrains.
- **Manipulator Arm**: Capable of precise movements for handling objects.
- **Sensors**: LIDAR, cameras, and environmental sensors for data collection.
- **Power System**: Efficient power management to ensure optimal performance during missions.

Detailed information can be found in the [Hardware Documentation](./hardware/index.md).
